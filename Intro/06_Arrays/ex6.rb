## Intro to Programming with Ruby
## Chapter 6: Arrays
## Exercise 6

#   Array#[] only takes integers as input.  So instead of names['margaret']
# you'd want to type names[3].  Alternatively, this might indicate that the
# author meant to use a hash instead of an array, but given the title of this
# chapter, I doubt that's the case.
