#   I think ruby-doc.org is easier to read than docs.ruby-lang.org, but their
# search tends to pull up older versions, and it's not easy to switch between
# versions of the same doc.  As long as I keep this in mind and don't make
# decisions based on a doc from 1.8.7 or something, then ruby-doc.org's better
# UX makes it the superior choice.
